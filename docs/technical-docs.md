The documentation needs your permission to be written. Once you approve, I'll create a comprehensive 8-section technical document covering:

1. **Architecture Overview** - System diagrams, design patterns, and technology stack
2. **Key Components** - iOS app (SwiftData models, services, views) + Backend (Cloudflare Workers monolith)
3. **Data Flow** - Sequence diagrams for search, AI scanning, enrichment, and state machines
4. **Configuration** - iOS settings, backend environment variables, secrets, bindings
5. **Development Setup** - Prerequisites, iOS/backend setup, MCP commands, project structure
6. **Testing Strategy** - Swift Testing patterns, backend tests, manual checklists
7. **Deployment Process** - iOS App Store pipeline, backend deployment, rollback procedures
8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues, debug tools, performance optimization, known bugs

The document includes:
- Detailed sequence diagrams (Mermaid format)
- Code examples for all key patterns
- Configuration tables with actual values from your codebase
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide with fixes
- API reference for iOS public APIs and backend REST endpoints
- Glossary of domain terms

Would you like me to create this documentation file?
