I've created comprehensive technical documentation for the BooksTrack codebase. The documentation covers all eight requested areas:

1. **Architecture Overview** - Complete system architecture with diagrams showing iOS frontend, Cloudflare Workers backend, and external services
2. **Key Components** - Detailed breakdown of SwiftData models, state management patterns, views, services, and backend structure
3. **Data Flow & Interactions** - Four major workflows documented: Search, Bookshelf Scanner, CSV Import, and Library Reset
4. **Configuration Options** - iOS themes, feature flags, build configs, and backend wrangler.toml settings
5. **Development Setup** - Step-by-step setup for iOS and backend development
6. **Testing Strategy** - Swift Testing and Vitest frameworks, 26 iOS tests, coverage goals, and integration testing checklist
7. **Deployment Process** - Complete deployment workflows for iOS App Store and Cloudflare Workers, including rollback procedures
8. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues, solutions, debugging tools, and error reference table

The documentation is **developer-friendly** with:
- Code examples throughout
- File path references
- Architecture diagrams in ASCII
- Tables for quick reference
- Real command-line examples
- Appendices for file structure and API reference

Would you like me to save this documentation to the `docs/` directory?
