Category B (Already Merged) - Audit Results
==============================================

Date: 2025-11-01
Task: Verify branches categorized as "already merged" have no unique work

FINDINGS:
---------

1. fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup
   - Unique commits: 5
   - Merge base: f1ba8b8 (main@-6 commits)
   - Status: SQUASH MERGED into main
   - Squash commit: aa54576 "fix: Complete Phase 1 test suite cleanup (#181, #180)"
   - Individual commits on branch:
     * 8927fde ci: Use iPhone 16 simulator (GitHub Actions doesn't have iPhone 17 yet)
     * 7dcd527 ci: Downgrade iOS platform to v18 for Swift 6.0 compatibility
     * 3e48422 ci: Downgrade Swift tools version to 6.0 for GitHub Actions compatibility
     * 118dee1 ci: Update to macos-15 runner for Xcode 16.2 support
     * 4a4a1bf fix: Complete Phase 1 test suite cleanup (#181, #180)

   ✅ CI CONFIGURATION VERIFICATION:
   - Main currently has: macos-15, Swift 6.0, iOS 18.0, iPhone 16
   - Branch CI commits: Same configuration (macos-15, Swift 6.0, iOS 18.0, iPhone 16)
   - File diff check: NO DIFFERENCES between main and branch CI files
   - CONCLUSION: CI commits already incorporated into main (same configuration)

   - FINAL RECOMMENDATION: ✅ SAFE TO DELETE (all work in main)

2. feature/jules-code-review-fixes
   - Unique commits: 4
   - Merge base: f1ba8b8 (main@-6 commits)
   - Status: SQUASH MERGED into main
   - Squash commit: cc69915 "refactor: Implement Jules' code review feedback (10 issues)"
   - Individual commits on branch:
     * 2a6725f revert: Remove editionsByID dictionary optimization (Gemini feedback)
     * aacccac refactor: Implement Jules' code review batch 3 (issues #160, #158, #167, #166)
     * c041129 refactor: Implement Jules' code review batch 2 (issues #174, #173, #172)
     * bc20f99 refactor: Implement Jules' code review batch 1 (issues #176, #175, #154)

   - Code differences from main:
     * Branch is BEHIND main (missing .branch-archive-2025-11-01.txt)
     * Branch is BEHIND main (missing cleanup plan docs)
     * Minor GitHub Actions workflow differences (negligible)

   - FINAL RECOMMENDATION: ✅ SAFE TO DELETE (all work in main)

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
-------------------

Both branches were squash-merged, meaning their CONTENT is in main but their
individual commit history is not. This is expected behavior for squash merges.

✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE:
- Both branches have their work fully incorporated in main
- No unique code changes exist on either branch
- CI configuration on fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup is identical to main
- All differences are due to main being ahead (newer commits)

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Both Category B branches are SAFE TO DELETE:
  1. fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup → Delete remote & local
  2. feature/jules-code-review-fixes → Delete remote only (local doesn't exist)

Git Commands to Execute:
  git push origin --delete fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup
  git branch -D fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup
  git push origin --delete feature/jules-code-review-fixes

COMMIT COUNTS (Summary):
------------------------
- fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup: 5 unique commits (all squashed into main@aa54576)
- feature/jules-code-review-fixes: 4 unique commits (all squashed into main@cc69915)

## Task 4: Dry-Run Deletion Results

**Execution Date:** 2025-11-01

**Dry-Run Command:**
```bash
xargs -I {} git push origin --delete --dry-run {} < branches-to-delete.txt
```

**Findings:**
- ✅ **17 branches verified for deletion** (showed `[deleted]` in dry-run)
- ❌ **2 branches already deleted remotely** (errors during dry-run):
  - `fix/phase1-test-suite-cleanup`
  - `feature/jules-code-review-fixes`

**Post-Dry-Run Verification:**
- Confirmed test branches still exist: `feat/edge-caching`, `feature/batch-enrichment` (count: 2)
- All 17 remaining branches confirmed to exist on remote

**Status:** ✅ Dry-run successful - ready for actual deletion of 17 branches

**Next Steps:**
- Update `branches-to-delete.txt` to remove 2 already-deleted branches
- Proceed with actual deletion of remaining 17 branches

✅ Final dry-run verification: No errors, 17 branches ready for deletion
