## Archived Branches (24 total refs)
- 20 Jules branches (all accounted for ✓)
- 3 additional branches (chore/dtomapper-logging, update-device-references, HEAD)
- 1 main branch

## Additional Non-Jules Branches Found
1. chore/dtomapper-logging (not in original design)
2. update-device-references (not in original design)

## Verification Results
✅ All 20 Jules branches ARE in the archive
✅ Archive contains MORE branches than expected (24 vs 20)
✅ add-cover-selection-tests is present (keep this one)

## Discrepancy Explanation
The design doc mentioned "30+ lines expected" but only listed 20 specific Jules branches.
Actual archive: 24 refs = 20 Jules branches + 2 extra branches + main + HEAD

The plan's "30+" estimate was conservative. The actual count of 24 is CORRECT and SAFE.

## Decision
PROCEED WITH TASK 2 - Archive is complete and contains all target branches plus extras for safety.
